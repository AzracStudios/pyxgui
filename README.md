pyXgui (Python XML Graphical User Interface) is a compact yet powerful frontend library that runs on <a href="https://www.raylib.com">Raylib</a>. It has a development experience similar to using a web framework like Svelte or React, providing features like reusable components, file system routing, state management etc. It aims to make the frontend developer experience in python a bit more comfortable. All components are defined in XML, styled with css and made functional with python.
